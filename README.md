# Chat application with socket.io.

## This app is built with node.js, express, axios.

### In this project there are two diffrent API:s and one REST-API. By typing "/" in the inputfield you are able to choosie one api of your choise and it will display depending on the choise. Ex a joke(Yo Mama), giff(random catgif) or leave the room(REST-API). When you press that you want to leave a room with the command in the message feild then you are disconnected from the room but can still log in to the room again with the correct password.

### Each time you enter the page, a form comes up where you have to enter a nickname, room name and password for the room. To write in a room, you have to click on the room you want to enter with the correct password (even if you have created your own room), if the password is incorrect then an alert will display for the user. These rooms will be displayed on the left side and when a user is inside a room the room name will appear at the top.
